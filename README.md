# jaeger-command

Jaeger in 30 seconds\* or less. This is a simple wrapper around the instructions provided in Jaeger's [Getting Started](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/getting-started/) guide for spinning up an instance of their all-in-one image for quick local tracing. Source `jaeger.sh` in your shell (works in zsh or bash) and go.
